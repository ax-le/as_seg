# Autosimilarity Segmentation - as_seg #

Hello, and welcome on this repository!

This package gathers code subject to segmentation of autosimilarity matrices.

This repository contains is mostly desgined for the CBM algorithm, as presented in [1, 2].

It will soon de uploaded on PyPi, for pip install. In the meantime, you can download the source files.

This is a first release, and may contain bug. Comments are welcomed!

## Software version ##

This code was developed with Python 3.8.5, and some external libraries detailed in dependencies.txt. They should be installed automatically if this project is downloaded using pip.

## Example Notebook ##

An example notebook will soon be available in the folder "Notebooks".

## Credits ##

Code was created by Axel Marmoret (<axel.marmoret@irisa.fr>), and strongly supported by Jeremy E. Cohen (<jeremy.cohen@cnrs.fr>).

The technique in itself was also developed by Nancy Bertin (<nancy.bertin@irisa.fr>) and Frédéric Bimbot (<bimbot@irisa.fr>).
